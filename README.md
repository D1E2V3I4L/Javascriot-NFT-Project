# Javascriot-NFT-Project
## This project is to create an NFT collection using my state as the parameter, utilizing resources like district names, food, places, and descriptions.
#### This project demonstrates the creation of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) representing various districts in Himachal Pradesh. Each NFT contains metadata about a district, including its name, image, popular travel destinations, local cuisine, and a description. This project uses JavaScript to mint, list, and track these NFTs.
# Features
* Minting NFTs: Create NFTs with specific metadata for each district.
* Listing NFTs: Display all minted NFTs with their metadata.
* Total Supply: Get the total number of NFTs created.

# Background
Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are unique digital assets that represent ownership or proof of authenticity of a particular item or piece of content. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, NFTs are not interchangeable on a one-to-one basis because each NFT has its unique properties and metadata.In this project, we explore the creation of NFTs for districts in Himachal Pradesh, a northern Indian state known for its stunning landscapes, rich cultural heritage, and delicious local cuisine. Each NFT encapsulates the essence of a district, making it a digital collectible that highlights the unique features of Himachal Pradesh's diverse regions.

# Metadata Attributes
Each NFT in this project includes the following attributes:

* District Name: The name of the district in Himachal Pradesh.
* Image: A representative image of the district.
* Travel Places: Popular travel destinations within the district.
* District Food: Notable local cuisine and food items from the district.
* Description: A brief description highlighting the unique aspects of the district.
